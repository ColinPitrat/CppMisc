Divers petits programmes en C++

Various small programs in C++

## Algorithms
A directory with small examples to play with STL algorithms.

## Huffman
A toy implementation of Huffman encoding.

## MergeIntervals
Merges intervals that overlaps.

## Model
A model directory for when I want to create a new C++ project.
Setup with a nice makefile and unit tests.

## StringBlocks
Format a string by set of 3 characters. I don't even remember why I ever did that ...

## Subsets
Compute all the subsets of a given set. Or if you prefer, all the combinations ...

## TransactionalStack
A stack supporting transactions (including nested transactions).
It means you can open a transaction, push/pop in the stack and then commit (the changes will remain valid) or rollback (the changes will be ignored).
This is not thread safe though !
